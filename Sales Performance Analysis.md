## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the sales performance of a retail store. 
By examining sales data, we aim to identify key insights into top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.
The analysis will be visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing a clear and engaging way to interpret the data,
enabling insights into the divers of revenue and high-demand products.

## Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is the Sales Data provided by the Store.

## Data Fields

-  Region: The geographic region where the store is located.
-  Market: The specific market or city where the store operates.
-  Total revenue: The total revenue generated by the sale, typically calculated by multiplying the quantity sold by the unit price.
-  Units Price: Refers to the cost per single unit of a product 
-  Customer ID: Customer ID is a unique identifier assigned to each customer in a database or sales system. 
-  Order ID is a unique identifier assigned to each purchase or transaction made by a customer.

## Basic statistics of the dataset:
- Total Sales: #68,461
- Total Revenue: #2,101,090
- Number of Regions: 4
- Total Number of Items: 6
- The dataset spans from 2023-2024

## Methodology
Data Preparation: I ensured the sales data was clean and structured, with columns for product, region, month, and sales figures.

###   Excel

-  Creating the Pivot Table:
  I selected the range of my data and then inserted a pivot table.
I set the rows to include Product and Region, and the columns to reflect Month.

I used the Values area to summarize Total Sales, applying the sum function to aggregate sales figures.

Analyzing the Results: The pivot table provided a clear summary of total sales by product, region, and month.
