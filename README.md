# Sales Performance Analysis
## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the sales performance of a retail store. 
By examining sales data, we aim to identify key insights into top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.
The analysis will be visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing a clear and engaging way to interpret the data,
enabling insights into the divers of revenue and high-demand products.

## Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is the Sales Data provided by the Store.

## Data Fields

Region: The geographic region where the store is located.
Market: The specific market or city where the store operates.
Total revenue: The total revenue generated by the sale, typically calculated by multiplying the quantity sold by the unit price.
Units Price: Refers to the cost per single unit of a product 
Customer ID: Customer ID is a unique identifier assigned to each customer in a database or sales system. 
Order ID is a unique identifier assigned to each purchase or transaction made by a customer.

## Basic statistics about the dataset:
- Total Sales: #345,000
- Total Revenue: #10,587,500
- Number of Region:4
- Total Number of Items:6
- The dataset spans from 2023-2024

## Methodology
Data Preparation: I ensured the sales data was clean and structured, with columns for product, region, month, and sales figures.

- Creating the Pivot Table:

In Excel, I selected the range of my data and then inserted a pivot table.
I set the rows to include Product and Region, and the columns to reflect Month.
I used the Values area to summarize Total Sales, applying the sum function to aggregate sales figures.
Analyzing the Results: The pivot table provided a clear summary of total sales by product, region, and month. 
For example, I could quickly see how much each product sold in different regions across various months, which helped identify trends and performance metrics.

- Visualization: I also created charts based on the pivot table to visualize the data more effectively, making it easier to present and understand key insights.

This process allowed for efficient data exploration and summary, helping to derive actionable insights from the sales data.
