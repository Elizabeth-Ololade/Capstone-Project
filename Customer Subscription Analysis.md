# Customer Subscription Analysis

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, 
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI 
dashboard to presents my analysis. 

## Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is the Customer Subscription Data provided.

## Data Fields

-  Region: The geographic region where the store is located.
-  Subscription Type: A subscription type typically refers to the different categories or models of subscription services
-  Cancellation: This refers to a customer's decision to terminate their subscription before the next billing cycle. 
-  Renewal: Renewal occurs when a customer decides to extend their subscription for another term, usually at the end of the initial period 
-  Revenue: Revenue is the total amount of money generated by a business from its sales of goods or services
-  Customer ID: Customer ID is a unique identifier assigned to each customer in a database or sales system. 
-  Subscription Duration: refers to the length of time for which a subscription service is active or valid. 


## Basic Statistics
-  Total Revenue: 67,540,175
-  Total Canceled: 15,175
-  Total Active: 18,612
-  Average Subscription Duration: 365
-  Total Regions: 4
-  Total Subscription: 3

## Methodology 
Data Preparation: I ensured the sales data was clean and structured, with columns for Subscription Type, region, Revenue, Subscription Pattern.

-  Creating the Pivot Table:
In Excel, I selected the range of my data and then inserted a pivot table. I set the rows to include Subscription Type, Value to reflect the revenue and the columns to reflect Region.

with the help of the pivot table, it is easy to interprete the data. I can see the sum of revenue genarated from each subscription type, from each region and the number of subscribers per subscription at a glance.

## SQL Query

The following SQL query was used to calculate The total number of subscribers from each region in the dataset:

SELECT Region, COUNT(customerID) AS total_customers
FROM[dbo].[CustomerData]
GROUP BY region;

### Result

Total Number of cancellation per region

SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS CancellationCount
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData]
WHERE Canceled = 1
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY CancellationCount DESC

### Result

Total Number of Active and Total Number of Cancelled

SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Canceled = 1 THEN 1 END) AS TotalCanceledSubscriptions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Canceled = 0 THEN 0 END) AS TotalActiveSubscriptions
FROM 
    CustomerData;

In this report, I implemented four key slicers to enhance data interaction and allow for tailored insights. Each slicer serves a specific purpose:

-  Subscription Duration Slicer:

This slicer allows you to filter the data based on the duration of subscriptions. ( 365/366 days)

-  Subscription Type Slicer:

With this slicer, you can filter the report by different subscription types (e.g., Basic, Premium, and Standard). This functionality helps to focus on particular segments of  subscriber base, making it easier to compare performance metrics across different types and identify opportunities for growth or improvement in specific areas.

-  Subscription Start Date Slicer:

This slicer allows to filter the data based on when subscriptions started by adjusting this slicer. 

-  Subscription End Date Slicer:

Similar to the start date slicer, this one lets you filter based on when subscriptions ended. This is particularly useful for examining churn patterns and understanding the lifecycle of subscriptions, helping to identify common factors that lead to cancellations.

### Benefits of Using Slicers
By utilizing these slicers, users can interactively refine the data displayed in the report, allowing for a more personalized analysis. You can quickly see how different subscription durations, types, and time frames affect key metrics, leading to deeper insights and more informed decision-making.
